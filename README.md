#### Algorithms_in_C
##### A bunch of useful pieces of code written in C to address algorithmic issues. 


3 Reasons why we should perform mathematical analysis of algorithms:
1. To compare different algorithms which execute the same job.
2. To predict the algorithms performances in new environments.
3. To set the values for the algorithms parameters.
